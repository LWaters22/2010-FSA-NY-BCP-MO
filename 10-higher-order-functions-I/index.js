100% optional project
Directions available on LearnDot
Program overview:
Input: a corpus of text (speech, song, poetry, prose)
Work: uses a Markov chain to turn input into n lines of new text (see workshop for details)
Output: a poem of n lines

Examples:
---------
Corpus from Trump’s victory speech and Clinton's concession speech (note the student added extra logic to turn the poems into haikus!) (https://repl.it/@hokevins/2017-02-27-FSBCPProjectRomancejs)
Corpus from a poem by Pablo Neruda; outputted poems tend to be quite angsty and occasionally romantic (https://repl.it/@tunguska_lore/poemMarkhovChain2)
Corpus from a scathing review of Guy Fieri’s restaurant in NYC (https://repl.it/@seanbert4/review-of-Guy-Fieris-this-tv-chef-restaurant)

 * when you get STUCK, 
 * if your code is not working and you don't know Why
 * OR if it's working and you don't know Why
 * 
 * 1) stop coding
 * 2) think about what you're trying to do.
 * 
 * what datatype(s) do you have?
 * how have you manipulated those datatypes in the past?
 * 
 * each datatype has a specific purpose, it's worth thinking about that purpose
