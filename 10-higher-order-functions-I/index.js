Output: a poem of n lines

Examples:
---------
Corpus from Trump’s victory speech and Clinton's concession speech (note the student added extra logic to turn the poems into haikus!) (https://repl.it/@hokevins/2017-02-27-FSBCPProjectRomancejs)
Corpus from a poem by Pablo Neruda; outputted poems tend to be quite angsty and occasionally romantic (https://repl.it/@tunguska_lore/poemMarkhovChain2)
Corpus from a scathing review of Guy Fieri’s restaurant in NYC (https://repl.it/@seanbert4/review-of-Guy-Fieris-this-tv-chef-restaurant)
