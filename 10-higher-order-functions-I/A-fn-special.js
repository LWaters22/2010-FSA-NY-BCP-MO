// Why are functions special?

/* Functions are special in JS becauseâ€¦they aren't special */

/* We think of functions as being different from other values in JS */

/* Strings, numbers, arrays: we're used to passing them into functions,or returning them from functions  */

/* But functions sometimes seem like they're in a different category, rooted to the line of code where they're defined */

/* In JS, functions are 'first-class objects', which is another way of saying that functions are like any other value in JS */
