// JavaScript consists of primitive values and complex values

/* primitive values in JS:
  - string
  - number
  - boolean
  - undefined
  - null

complex values in JS:
  - objects (including arrays)
  - functions
 */

// We separate these variables into these categories because of the way they behave in different situations (which you'll see in the coming examples)

/* But the main question we're going to be tackling in this lecture is:
Why do primitive values and complex values behave differently?
/*
Notes:
