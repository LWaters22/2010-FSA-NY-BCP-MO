/*
Visualize a primitive variable as follows:
-------------------------------
variable = labeled box
label = name of the variable
inside the box = value of the variable

Example:
--------
let x = 5;
x is the label of the box
5 is the contents of the box

I will portray that example as follows:
--------------------------------------
/*
x: 5
*/
