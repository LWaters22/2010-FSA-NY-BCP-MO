// Let's see how .slice with arrays fits into this

/* we showed earlier that .slice creates a copy of an array */

// console.log(array1 === array2);// are they equal?

// But what if some of the elements inside the array were complex values themselves (ex. array, object)

/* if an array has a complex value as an element, only the REFERENCE to that complex value is copied into the new array */
